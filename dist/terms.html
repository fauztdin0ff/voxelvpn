                                 shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be

                                 of
                                 arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Voxel Security
                                 Group will pay as
                                 much
                                 of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration
                                 as the arbitrator
                                 deems reasonably necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If,
                                 however, the
                                 arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is
                                 improper or not
                                 warranted,
                                 as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b),
                                 then the payment of
                                 any
                                 arbitration costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to
                                 reimburse Voxel Security
                                 Group for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to
                                 pay under the AAA
                                 Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the
                                 value of your demand,
                                 Voxel Security Group shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys' fees and
                                 expenses incurred in
                                 connection with such arbitration.

                                       at the time you purchased the Services (e.g. either 1 month or 12 months); and
                                       (ii) in respect of
                                       all additional services, 12 months (the “Initial Term”). Except in the case of

                                       ordered, as shall be further summarized for you in the Renewal Notice (described
                                       below).

                                       On occasion, it may be necessary for us to amend your renewal to provide you with
                                       the best service
                                       possible and you will be charged at the equivalent pro rata amount. Should this
                                       happen, you will be
