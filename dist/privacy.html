                        <li>
                           the Data Protection Act 2018; and
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           any other privacy related laws or regulations the UK may implement as a result of it leaving

                     <p>
                        As a company we are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of your personal
                        information. We want you
                        to be confident that your information will be properly protected whilst in our possession.

                     <p>
                        The Privacy Policy below explains how we, and carefully selected third parties we work with,

                     </p>

                     <p>
                        We will only ever use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use

                        information in the following circumstances:
                     </p>

                           you.</li>

                        <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate business interests (or those of a third party) and
                           your interests and

                        <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>

                     </ul>

                     <p>
                        Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information
                        other than in

                     <p>
                        Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area
                        (<strong>EEA</strong>) and the
                        United Kingdom so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside
                        the EEA and the
                        United Kingdom.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA (where relevant) or the United Kingdom,
                        we ensure a similar
                        degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
                        implemented:
                     </p>

                     <ul>

                        <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                           ‘adequate’ level of
                           protection for personal data by the relevant authority or body.
                        </li>

                        <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the by the
                           relevant
                           authority or body (Model Clauses)
                        </li>

                        <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the
                           Privacy Shield
                           (or similar arrangement) which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data
                           shared between the
                           UK and the US; or
                        </li>

                        <li>Any other safeguard approved by the UK Government or Information Commissioner’s Office.</li>

                        <strong>Your rights in connection with personal information.</strong> Under certain
                        circumstances, by law you have
                        the right to:

                           <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a “data
                           subject access
                           request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we
                           hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
                        </li>

                           <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to

                           information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see
                           below).
                        </li>

                           (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
                           situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You
                           also have the right to object where we are processing your personal

                     <i>No fee usually required</i>

                     <p>
                        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the
                        other rights).
                        However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or
                        excessive.
                        Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure
                        your right to
                        access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate
                        security measure to
                        ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

                     <p>
                        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us
                        longer than a month if
                        your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we
                        will notify you and
                        keep you updated.
